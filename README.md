C++ Practice Code Samples
=========================

C++ practice code samples from:
-------------------------------
***Sams Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days, 5th Edition***
*Copyright Â© 2005 by Sams Publishing*


Samples of code from the book and a few I just wrote up using the techniques learned, or modified a bit, while learning C++ from the book.


I am adding this on github so I can pull and continue from my cell in termux or anywhere. But anyone is free to view and copy to have while learning C++ from the book.


*I don't know about adding the pdf here, because of copyright issues, but I will post a **[public link](http://openstorage.gunadarma.ac.id/pub/journal/Teach%20Yourself%20C++%20in%2021%20Days%205th%20Edition.pdf)** where you can find it online.*
